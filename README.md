# Speed Post Tracking

A unofficial guide on how to [track Speed Post online](http://www.dtdctrack.in/speed-post-tracking-india-post-track/) or EMS India Post packages. This can be used in your website or application or just a user. Note: This doesn't contain any code for integration.

It is a general brand name for accelerated delivery services provided by Postal Department. India Post tracking module is used in a lots of corporate websites and eCommerce portals. They directly have access to API from the postal network. However, it is not open to the public. You need to contact them in order to request access.

There are 3 different types of Speed Post carriers:

1. **India Post EMS:** India Post has been affiliated with international EMS network to provide a common tracking portal for all your parcels.
2. **International:** International Speed Post provides courier services outside of India. 
3. **Singapore Post:** This is a completely unrelated carrier which is based in Singapore. This carrier is not supported by our library. However, we wish to add support in future.

##Ways to Implement Tracking

Because there is no official API, you can perform screen scraping. However, it is critical that you obtain consent from them before actually scraping as it may violate their terms. Screen scraping of it's website is not straightforward either. It has a captcha system which needs to be manually entered. This method is not generally recommended.

The other way is to integrate third party websites like Aftership, Easypost, e.t.c which already provide an API for Speed Post status checking. You need to sign up for their services and use their official integration guide for help.

Let's hope in the future that they release an official API for public usage.
