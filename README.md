# Speed Post Tracking

A nifty library to provide easy access to track Speed Post or EMS India Post packages.

There are 3 different types of Speed Post carriers:

1. India Post EMS: India Post has been affiliated with international EMS network to provide a common tracking portal for all your parcels.
2. International: International Speed Post provides courier services outside of India. 
3. Singapore Post: This is a completely unrelated carrier which is based in Singapore.


This is possible through the My Government initiative of the Indian I.T ministry. It provides datasets and APIs for gathering public data for free.
